-title "PTW Help" -desc "Let\'s get this bread!

TO USE:
First, make sure your custom counters have been set up! If you haven\'t already done so, execute `!RC`.

__Syntax:__
`!ptw <lifestyle> [-e <new_employer_name> -c <new_check_name> -b <new_bonus_value>] <adv>`"

-f "Initial Setup|The first time you run this command, you should provide, at minimum, a `new_employer_name` and a `new_check_name`.
__Examples:__
`!ptw modest -e \"The Drunken Yeti\" -c performance`
`!ptw poor -e \"Messenger Service\" -c acrobatics`

If your job calls for a tool check, your check name should be the stat associated with the tool.
Proficiency and expertise bonuses will not be automatically added, in this case;
to add them, provide a `new_bonus_value`.

__Examples:__
`!ptw wealthy -e \"The Drunken Yeti\" -c charisma -b 2`"

-f "Next Time|You can now just run `!ptw <lifestyle>`. 
Don't pass an `employer_name` this time, or else your wages and job will get reset.
You can still change `check_name` and modify `bonus_value` with no problems.
If you have advantage on the check, you can specify this by appending `adv` to the command.

__Examples:__
`!ptw modest`
`!ptw modest adv`
`!ptw modest -c athletics adv`"

-f "help|`!ptw ?` or `!ptw help`
